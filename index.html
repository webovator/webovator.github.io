        Welcome to my quick and dirty intro page for GitHub. 
        I'm a graphic designer and modest front end coder who is learning Ruby on Rails.
        I started learning HTML, and CSS back in the 90's (then later Javascript in the 2000's) 
        and worked as a full time freelancer off and on for about 10 years.
        I gradually grew to be frustrated with problem clients who liked to pay late or not at all, 
        so I decided to take a break and explore other career paths for a while.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #444444">
        Now after being away from the web design industry for about 2 years, I know a lot has changed. 
        So please excuse the mess.  
        This is just a quick and dirty intro to satisfy a homework task on Skillcrush, 
        where I'm currently studing Ruby and embarking on a path that should take me more into development than design.
      </p>

        I'm new to GitHub so I intend to learn as much as I can, and 
        update this page later with some of my interesting projects.
        Right now I am working on building a spaced repetition web app 
        that will help English speakers learn Tagalog (Filipino).

        In my spare time I like playing my guitar, learning Japanese, and listening to podcasts.

        I taught my 9 year old Atreyu to build sites with HTML and he's learning Ruby now, too! Right now I'm showing him color hexcodes below.
